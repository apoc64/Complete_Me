# Complete_Me
## Steve Schwedt, Zachary Thomas 

### Testing
 * From the directory complete_me, run 'rake test' to test both trie and node functionality, and also runs simplecov over both tests.

### Shoes
Shoes is notoriously finicky, and not particularly intuitive to run. Here's what you'll need to open the ui included.
##### Installation:

 * at http://shoesrb.com/downloads/ download your relevant version of shoes 
 * open this file, and move it into your applications
 * from here launch the application and and either select "Run An App" or use the cmd + o shortcut
 * ## DO NOT LAUNCH THE APPLICATION IF IT IS ALREADY RUNNING. YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO EXIT THE APPLICATION
